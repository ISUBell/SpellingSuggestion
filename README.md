# SpellingSuggestion

This is a project that aims to be a simple to implement spelling suggestion tool.

It currently will parse valid team names from sports-reference.com and return valid school names.

The end goal of this project is to expand it's capability to be able to auto parse various input sources.

The initial setup of the project has been geared towards eventual integration into the Sports Team Reference project in my other repo.
